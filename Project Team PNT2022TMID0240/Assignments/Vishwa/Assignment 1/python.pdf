PYTHON IS A POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:
• When Guido van Rossum was creating python in the 1980s, he made sure to 
design it to be a general-purpose language. One of the main reasons for the 
popularity of python would be its simplicity in syntax so that it could be easily 
read and understood even by amateur developers also.
• Python was created more than 30 years ago, which is a lot of time for any 
community of programming language to grow and mature adequately to
support developers ranging frombeginner to expert levels.
• There are plenty of documentation, guides and Video Tutorials for Python 
language are available that learner and developer of any skill level or ages
can use and receive the support
• The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages 
available becauseit has simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more 
emphasis on natural language.
• Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and 
executed muchfaster than other programming languages.
FRAMEWORKS USED WITH PYTHON:
1. DJANGO
Django is an open-source, full-stack Python framework. It follows the DRY (Don’t 
Repeat Yourself) principle. Django comes equipped with a vast line of ready-to-use 
libraries. Some of its most exceptional features are authentication, URL routing, 
template engine, object-relational mapper (ORM), and database schema
migrations. Together, these make Django highly scalable,fast, and versatile.
2. TURBOGEARS
TurboGears is an open-source, data-driven, full-stack Python framework. It 
incorporates some of the best components of other Python frameworks and comes 
with many useful libraries. It allows developers to build data-driven web
applications very fast.
3. WEB2PY
Web2py is a highly scalable, open-source full-stack Python framework. It comes 
with its individual web-based IDE that includes a code editor, debugger, and a 
one-click deploymentfeature.
4. CHERRYPY
CherryPy is one of the oldest open-source, object-oriented Python microframeworks.
Following a minimalistic approach, CherryPy is designed for extensibility. It includes 
mechanisms for hookpoints and extensions. Moreover, the “cherry” on top is that any
CherryPy-based web application is a standalone Python application having its
unique embedded multi-threaded web server.
5. FLASK
Flask is a Python microframework available under the BSD license. It drew
inspiration from the Sinatra Ruby framework. Flask requires Jinja2 template and 
Werkzeug WSGI toolkit to run. It has a lightweight and modular design that makes 
it easily adaptable to a wide range of development needs.
